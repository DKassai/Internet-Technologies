1. To implement the functionality, after watching the explanation videos from the TA, we figured out how to properly set up our network and routing tables.

2. We were not able to get traceroute to properly work 100% of the time, possibly due to incorrect function calls in the mininet.

3. Initially we were very confused with how to approach the project entirely, but after watching the TA's explanation videos, we were able to get it in a working state. The next issue we ran into was the traceroute not working. After, I assume many people complained about that being an issue, we followed the directions in a subsequent email, which for the most part solved our issue.

4. We enhanced our understanding of routing table and communication on basic networks.
